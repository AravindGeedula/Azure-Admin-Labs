# Task 9: Stop Virtual Machine

### Objective
Stop a running virtual machine to save costs and avoid unnecessary billing.

### Steps
1. In the **Azure Portal**, go to **Virtual Machines**.
2. Select the VM created earlier (Task 2).
3. On the VM overview page, click **Stop**.
4. Confirm the action.

### Verification
- VM status changes to **Stopped (deallocated)**.
- No further compute charges will apply while the VM is stopped.

### Notes
Always deallocate VMs when not in use to control costs during labs.
