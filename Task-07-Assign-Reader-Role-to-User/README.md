# Task 7: Assign Reader Role to User

### Objective
Assign the **Reader** role to the user `testuser01` in order to provide read-only access to resources.

### Steps
1. Navigate to the **Azure Portal** → Open the **Resource Group** created earlier.
2. Go to **Access control (IAM)** → `+ Add` → **Add role assignment**.
3. In the Role tab:
   - Select **Reader** role.
4. In the Members tab:
   - Click **+ Select members**.
   - Search and select `testuser01`.
5. Review + Assign.

### Verification
- Verified that `testuser01` is listed under **Role assignments** with the **Reader** role.
- Confirmed that user has **read-only access** (cannot modify or delete resources).

### Notes
This task demonstrates role-based access control (RBAC).  
The Reader role is the least-privileged built-in role, granting only view permissions.
