# Task 5: Upload Blob to Container

### Objective
Upload a blob (file) into a container inside the Azure Storage Account.

### Steps
1. Open the **Azure Portal** → Navigate to the **Storage Account** created in Task 4.
2. Under **Data storage**, select **Containers** → `+ Container`.
   - Container name: `demo-container`
   - Public access level: Private (default)
3. After container creation, click **Upload**.
   - Select a sample file (e.g., text file or image).
   - Keep defaults → Upload.

### Verification
- Blob successfully uploaded and visible in the container.
- Verified properties (URL, size, type).
- Confirmed that blob can be accessed from the portal (depending on access level).

### Notes
This blob can later be used for testing access control, shared access signatures (SAS), and other storage features.
